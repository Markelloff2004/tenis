# Ping Pong Tournament

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

### Run from IDE

1. Make sure the **MySQL** (or other) database container is running correctly.
2. Verify that the database connection URL is correct in the `application.properties` file:
3. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
4. Locate the `Application` class (in `src/main/java`).
5. Run the `main` method in that class.
6. The application will be available at: http://localhost:8080


## Deploying using Docker

To build the Dockerized version of the project, you will need:
1. Make sure the database connection URL in `application.properties` is correctly set to connect to the containerized database.
2. Build the application and start the containers using:
    ```bash
      mvn clean package -Pproduction
      docker-compose up --build -d
     ```
3. The application will be available at: [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
4. To stop and remove all containers, volumes, and networks created by Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
